## Rest API to implement the game

### Backlog 

US 1 : as a player I ask a question to another player ,( no persistence, no secuity , no check for player)

### Constraint

1) using ATDD approach
2) TDD
    1) writing unit test until it fails ( compilation error is a failing test)
    2) writing implementation until the unit test pass ( if UT pass do not add code in impl )
    3) repeat until you can't write failing unit test  
3) Peer programing / Mob programing
